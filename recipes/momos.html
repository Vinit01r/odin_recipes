    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Momos are a type of steamed dumpling that originated in Tibet and Nepal but have become a beloved street food across India and other parts of Asia. Made from a simple dough of refined flour, these bite-sized delights are filled with flavorful mixtures such as finely chopped vegetables, chicken, paneer, or meat. The filling is wrapped in thin dough sheets and then steamed until soft and tender. Momos are usually served hot with a spicy red chutney or mayonnaise, creating a perfect balance between the mild, juicy dumplings and the fiery dip.

        Beyond just being a snack, momos represent comfort and community. They’re often enjoyed with friends at roadside stalls or cafes, especially during evenings. Over time, many variations have emerged — like fried momos, tandoori momos, and even cheese-filled or chocolate momos — each with its own twist on the original recipe. Their soft texture, flavorful fillings, and spicy accompaniments have made momos one of the most loved fast foods in India and beyond.
