    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A burger is a popular fast food item made by placing a cooked patty—usually made of minced meat like beef, chicken, or vegetables—between two halves of a soft, round bun. It is often layered with fresh ingredients such as lettuce, tomato slices, onions, and cheese, and topped with condiments like ketchup, mayonnaise, or mustard. The combination of a juicy patty, crispy vegetables, and flavorful sauces makes the burger both satisfying and versatile, allowing it to be enjoyed in countless variations around the world.</p>

    <p>Beyond just being a quick meal, the burger has become a global culinary icon. From street food stalls to gourmet restaurants, it’s served in many forms — from the classic cheeseburger to modern plant-based versions. Burgers represent comfort, convenience, and creativity in food culture. Whether grilled at a family barbecue, ordered at a fast-food joint, or crafted with gourmet ingredients, a burger always delivers a delicious mix of textures and flavors that make it universally loved.</p>
